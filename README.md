# import-netflix-viewing-history

I had a different Netflix account, and now I have a different one. Since Netflix only provides an option to export the Netflix Viewing History but not the way to import to another account, I had to do this manually so I don't lose track of what I was watching.


### How this works?

Well, this is just an automated script to do these steps so I don't have to do things manually.
- Open Browser
- Login in to Netflix
- Read each title from csv
- Search the show
- Click at the end of the show

This may look stupid, but losing watched history confuses me if I have watched any particular episode. Hence, this script. Also I wanted this to be a good Python learning experience :)
